This is a backend node.js application that will host the data for the frontend receiptbook web application. This node.js project can be ran locally or remotely as it has also been deployed to Heroku.

If ran locally you first need to install git bash and npm. Download this repo to your local computer. Browse to the repo folder on your machine using 
git or a command prompt and run npm install. Run npm start and you will be able to access the endpoints from Postman via http://localhost:3000/api/v1. 
You can also use the following endpoint to access the backend pushed to heroku: https://receiptbookhonestwoman.herokuapp.com/api/v1/. Endpoint schemas are Authentication, Users and Receipts.

If you want to access the rest api endpoints via heroku please review the attached document to this project entitled Receiptbook API Documentation.docx. It gives full details to each endpoint within the Rest api web services.
